# dialupsimulator
Simulates dial up! The application will play real dialing sounds depending on the number entered into the number to dial box. 

If you choose, the application can also enable and disable a network adapter of your choice. Be reminded of how long it took to get online!

The application requires administrative privileges to enable/disable network adapters. 

You can run the application without compiling the source code by running DialUpSimulator.exe.
